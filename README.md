To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

```bash
ng build
```

```bash
ng test
```
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```
